Library for autodection charset of russian text

LibRCD is used by RusXMMS project for encoding auto-detection. It is optimized 
to handle very short titles, like ID3 tags, file names and etc, and provides 
very high accuracy even for short 3-4 letter words. Current version supports 
Russian and Ukrainian languages and able to distinguish UTF-8, KOI8-R, CP1251, 
CP866, ISO8859-1. If compared with Enca, LibRCC provides better detection 
accuracy on short titles and is able to detect ISO8859-1 (non-cyrillic)
encoding what allows to properly display correct ID3 v.1 titles.
